            <h2>CS 2300: Intermediate Design and Programming for the Web</h2>
            <p>
                Web programming requires the cooperation of two machines: the one in 
                front of the viewer (client) and the one delivering the content (server). 
                INFO 1300 concentrates almost exclusively on the client side. The main 
                emphasis in INFO 2300 is learning about server side processing. Students 
                begin with a short overview of the PHP server-side scripting language, 
                then look at interactions with databases, learning about querying via 
                the database language SQL. Through a succession of projects, students 
                learn how to apply this understanding to the creation of an interactive, 
                data-driven site via PHP and the MYSQL database. Also considered are 
                technologies such as Javascript and Ajax and techniques to enhance security 
                and privacy. Design and usability issues are emphasized. A major component 
                of the course is the creation of a substantial web site. 
            </p>

            <h2>CS 3410: Systems Programming</h2>
            <p>
                Introduction to computer organization, systems programming and the 
                hardware/ software interface. Topics include instruction sets, computer 
                arithmetic, datapath design, data formats, addressing modes, memory 
                hierarchies including caches and virtual memory, I/O devices, bus-based 
                I/O systems, and multicore architectures. Students learn assembly 
                language programming and design a pipelined RISC processor. 
            </p>

            <h2>CS 4670: Intro to Computer Vision</h2>
            <p>
                An in-depth introduction to computer vision. The goal of computer vision 
                is to compute properties of our world—the 3D shape of an environment, 
                the motion of objects, the names of people or things—through analysis 
                of digital images or videos. The course covers a range of topics, including 
                3D reconstruction, image segmentation, object recognition, and vision 
                algorithms for the Internet, as well as key algorithmic and optimization 
                techniques, such as graph cuts and non-linear least squares. This course 
                emphasizes hands-on experience with computer vision, with several large 
                programming projects.
            </p>

            <h2>CS 4752: Robotic Manipulation</h2>
            <p>
                Robotic manipulation is the ability for a robot to interact physically and 
                deliberately in the world. Although long used in factories, robot manipulators 
                will soon appear in home environments as well, helping us with daily tasks.  
                This course covers the theory and concepts involved in programming a robot 
                manipulator, including rigid body mechanics, kinematics, dynamics, path 
                and trajectory planning, control, and stability.  At the end of this course, 
                the student is able to program a real manipulator arm to perform autonomous 
                tasks.
            </p>

            <h2>CS 1300: Intro Design &amp; Prog for Web</h2>
            <p>
                The World Wide Web is both a technology and a pervasive and powerful resource 
                in our society and culture. To build functional and effective web sites, 
                students need technical and design skills as well as analytical skills for 
                understanding who is using the web, in what ways they are using it, and for 
                what purposes. In this course, students develop skills in all three of these 
                areas through the use of technologies such as XHTML, Cascading Stylesheets, 
                and PHP. Students study how web sites are deployed and used, usability issues 
                on the web, user-centered design, and methods for visual layout and information 
                architecture. Through the web, this course provides an introduction to the 
                interdisciplinary field of information science. 
            </p>

            <h2>CS 2800: Discrete Structures</h2>
            <p>
                This course covers the mathematics that underlies most of computer science.

                predicate calculus; combinatorics and discrete mathematics; some basic 
                elements of basic probability theory; basic number theory; sets, functions, 
                and relations; graphs; and finite-state machines. These topics are discussed 
                in the context of applications to many areas of computer science, such as the 
                RSA cryptosystem and web searching.
            </p>

            <h2>MATH 2940: Linear Algebra for Engineers</h2>

                vector spaces, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, orthogonality and inner product 
                spaces; applications include brief introductions to difference equations, 
                Markov chains, and systems of linear ordinary differential equations. May 
                include computer use in solving problems. 
            </p>

            <h2>CS 1300: Intro Design &amp; Programming for Web</h2>
            <p>
                This course offers the opportunity to master the World Wide Web by 
                learning to build websites of your own through HTML, CSS, Javascript, 
                PHP, and JQuery. Throughout the semester we will be designing various 
                webpages and discovering the science behind common web elements. 
                However, the focus is not just on the code, layout and styling also 
                comprise a large amount of the subject matter.
            </p>

            <h2>CS 2110: Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures</h2>
            <p>
                As the next Java course after AP Computer Science, CS 2110 includes review
                of class structure and recursion as well as an in-depth study of data types. 
                Further along in the course, more advanced topics are taught 
                (e.g. complexity analysis and graph algorithms.)

                electronic component (e.g. Vacuum Tube Amplifiers, Transistors). Fabricated 
                our own semiconductor devices (Solar Cells) in the nano lab and studied 
                other forms of solid state electronics. In addition, there was also a final 
                class project where my partner and I created a wearable lie detector glove

                through writing and acting. Through in-class discussions and peer review, we 
                honed our critical and persuasive writing while developing exact, articulate, 
                and well-structured arguments.
