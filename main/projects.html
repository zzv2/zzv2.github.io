            <h3>Augmented Reality Remote Arm Controller - Codename: Gatlin</h3>
            <!--<img class="resizable" style="max-width: 706px;" src="../projects/gatlin/diagram.png" alt=""/>-->
            <p>
                The camera on the back of the mobile device captures the user's hand pose while the screen displays the calculated
                location of the hand overlaid on top of the 3D view from the Kinect on the robot. The mobile device's screen
                acts like a window into the robot's perspective. The mobile device's gyroscopes allow precise tracking of orientation, and utilizing the gyroscopes makes the app much more immersive 
                since when you turn the mobile device, the view rotates accordingly. The arm's end effector would then copy the pose of the user's hand, allowing the user to reach
                for an object and grasp it as if the user was standing where the robot is. The pros of this method is that only a mobile device
                with a camera is needed to capture hand movements. Thus this will allow the robot controller to be packaged in a app and anyone with a smartphone 
                could then download it to their phone and control the robot remotely. (security authentication will be added so not just anyone can access the robot)
                <br>
                <br>
                Although I have just begun to experiment with Unity and ROS, the combination seems to have many possibilities and applications.
                Here is a short video demo of an initial prototype for the robot's Android controller app, showing a visualization of the RGBD data from the 
                Kinect, joystick controls for moving the robot, and gyro controls for viewing the 3D pointcloud.

                The mobile app was created using Unity and the Unity-ROS connection was implemented using the ROS packages "rosbridge" and "web_video_server". 
                Here is a schema for another ROS web interface that we used as a guide during the beginning of this project.

            <h3>Team Members: Zach Zweig-Vinegar, Fred Kummer</h3>
            <p>Final class project for ENGRI 1820: Electricity Lights Camera Action: 
                Nanoengineering for the Future of Bits and Bytes. </p>
            <p>It is a simple lightweight stress sensor that fits around the wrist 
                which senses your stress level using heart and galvanic skin response 
                and indicates it with an LED of different colors. This could certainly
                be useful to an ordinary person as a way of tracking everyday stress,
                but also has potential medical applications, allowing doctors and patients 
                to quickly and easily determine the patients stress level, which would 
                be useful in managing a variety of illnesses from heart disease to anxiety disorders.
                <br/>
                <br/>It was created by taking advantage of the fact
                that the sensors and microcontrollers needed already exist and are easily accessible. 
                This allowed us to focus on integrating them into a functioning system rather 
                than worrying about the specifics of each sensor and to devote more time to the 
                problem of accurately interpreting the data and making them work as flexible electronics.
                <br/>
                <br/>Resources: A tessellated surface that can fit around the wrist, an Arduino 
                microcontroller that can be used to interpret the data, a heart rate or pulse sensor, 
                a galvanic skin response sensor or the materials needed to construct one 
                (a fairly simple operation that mainly requires a conductive surface and an Arduino
                to regulate the data), multicolored LEDs to indicate your stress level, batteries, and wire.

                This project utilizes a program that allows the user to easily collect temperature data from
                inexpensive thermistor temperature sensors connected to the computer 
                through an Arduino. Contains a Java UI for the Arduino USB 
                serial connection. Converts the voltage through the thermistor into a 
                temperature. Allows the user to set the duration and sampling rate for 
                the data collection. Provides real-time graphs of data...

                "For this project, our client is a small company called Physics Bus, founded by Erik Herman. Physics Bus is a refurbished old style bus that travels to schools and events as a
                mobile physics exhibit. The mission of Physics Bus is two fold: first, to spark interest in physics and science in audiences of all ages through fun and
                interactive exhibits, emphasizing the artistic and creative aspects of physics rather than straight equationsÍ¾ second, the exhibits in the bus are made from also
                entirely recycled and/or junk materials. The current URL for the Physics Bus site is <a href="http://ithacaphysicsfactory.weebly.com/">http://ithacaphysicsfactory.weebly.com/</a>
                (physicsbus.org), but our client has expressed his unhappiness with the overall theme, color scheme, and even logo of the site (which is just a slightly modified version of the 
                logo for the parent organization, Physics Factory).
                What our client was looking for in their site was something that embodies the fun and interactive elements of their project. In particular, our client mentioned
                that he likes the look of hero images and requested a slideshow on the website's main page. He was also looking for a site that effectively uses social media,
                blogging, and videos/images to give users a taste of what the Physics Bus is like."

                match part time cleaners with customers (for the purposes of this project we may decide to focus on the Ithaca area). The website we
                built is intended to be an alpha version of the company's final product and will mostly be used for product demos to potential
                investors... <br>
                <br>
                The website's main purpose is to connect customers who need household cleaning services with providers 
                in their local area. The content will reflect this purpose as well as make it as easy to use as possible. 
                We plan to incorporate many features, so it should be very simple to facilitate communication between 
                customers and cleaners. This will ensure that target audience enjoys this service as much as our client does."

                the text and most people associate black backgrounds with computer consoles
                or terminals. I also wanted the website to feel sleek and modern, just like the
                iOS and Android operating systems which is why I incorporated large icons
                and a CSS flip for interaction...
