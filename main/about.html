    <p>
        I am a senior computer science major in the the College of Engineering at Cornell University.
        My current research interests lie in the areas of human-robot interaction, computer vision,
        and augmented reality. I am also a member of Cornell's Robotic Personal Assistants Lab
        run by Prof. Ross Knepper. Currently, I am working on a telepresence robot equipped with a 360 degree
        RGB-D sensor. The goal is to use the data coming from the sensor to enable the robot to
        seamlessly and smoothly navigate crowded pedestrian environments. More details about me can be found in my resume.
