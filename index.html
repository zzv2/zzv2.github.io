                    I am a senior computer science major in the the College of Engineering at Cornell University.
                    My current research interests lie in the areas of human-robot interaction, computer vision,
                    and augmented reality. I am also a member of the Cornell's Robotic Personal Assistants Lab
                    run by Prof. Ross Knepper. Currently, I am working on a telepresence robot equipped with a 360 degree
                    RGB-D sensor. The goal is to use the data coming from the sensor to enable the robot to
                    seamlessly and smoothly navigate crowded pedestrian environments. In this website you can find
                    information about me and my research. More details about me can be found in my resume.

                    <p>
                        The camera on the back of the mobile device captures the user's hand pose while the screen displays the calculated
                        location of the hand overlaid on top of the 3D view from the Kinect on the robot. The mobile device's screen
                        acts like a window into the robot's perspective. The mobile device's gyroscopes allow precise tracking of orientation, and utilizing the gyroscopes makes the app much more immersive
                        since when you turn the mobile device, the view rotates accordingly. The arm's end effector would then copy the pose of the user's hand, allowing the user to reach
                        for an object and grasp it as if the user was standing where the robot is. The pros of this method is that only a mobile device
                        with a camera is needed to capture hand movements. Thus this will allow the robot controller to be packaged in a app and anyone with a smartphone
                        could then download it to their phone and control the robot remotely. (security authentication will be added so not just anyone can access the robot)

                        Although I have just begun to experiment with Unity and ROS, the combination seems to have many possibilities and applications.
                        Here is a short video demo of an initial prototype for the robot's Android controller app, showing a visualization of the RGBD data from the
                        Kinect, joystick controls for moving the robot, and gyro controls for viewing the 3D pointcloud.

                        Nanoengineering for the Future of Bits and Bytes. </p>
                    <p>It is a simple lightweight stress sensor that fits around the wrist
                        which senses your stress level using heart and galvanic skin response
                        and indicates it with an LED of different colors. This could certainly
                        be useful to an ordinary person as a way of tracking everyday stress,
                        but also has potential medical applications, allowing doctors and patients
                        to quickly and easily determine the patients stress level, which would
                        be useful in managing a variety of illnesses from heart disease to anxiety disorders.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>It was created by taking advantage of the fact
                        that the sensors and microcontrollers needed already exist and are easily accessible.
                        This allowed us to focus on integrating them into a functioning system rather
                        than worrying about the specifics of each sensor and to devote more time to the
                        problem of accurately interpreting the data and making them work as flexible electronics.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>Resources: A tessellated surface that can fit around the wrist, an Arduino
                        microcontroller that can be used to interpret the data, a heart rate or pulse sensor,
                        a galvanic skin response sensor or the materials needed to construct one
                        (a fairly simple operation that mainly requires a conductive surface and an Arduino
                        to regulate the data), multicolored LEDs to indicate your stress level, batteries, and wire.

                        mobile physics exhibit. The mission of Physics Bus is two fold: first, to spark interest in physics and science in audiences of all ages through fun and
                        interactive exhibits, emphasizing the artistic and creative aspects of physics rather than straight equations; second, the exhibits in the bus are made from also
                        entirely recycled and/or junk materials. The current URL for the Physics Bus site is <a href="http://ithacaphysicsfactory.weebly.com/">http://ithacaphysicsfactory.weebly.com/</a>
                        (physicsbus.org), but our client has expressed his unhappiness with the overall theme, color scheme, and even logo of the site (which is just a slightly modified version of the
                        logo for the parent organization, Physics Factory).
                        What our client was looking for in their site was something that embodies the fun and interactive elements of their project. In particular, our client mentioned
                        that he likes the look of hero images and requested a slideshow on the website's main page. He was also looking for a site that effectively uses social media,
                        blogging, and videos/images to give users a taste of what the Physics Bus is like."

                        "Our client is Ada Chan, an MBA candidate at Cornell. She is the founder of a company that intends to create an online solution to
                        match part time cleaners with customers (for the purposes of this project we may decide to focus on the Ithaca area). The website we
                        built is intended to be an alpha version of the company's final product and will mostly be used for product demos to potential
                        investors... <br>
                        <br>
                        The website's main purpose is to connect customers who need household cleaning services with providers
                        in their local area. The content will reflect this purpose as well as make it as easy to use as possible.
                        We plan to incorporate many features, so it should be very simple to facilitate communication between
                        customers and cleaners. This will ensure that target audience enjoys this service as much as our client does."

                        CS projects, so I want to reflect the coding aspect in the look and feel of my
                        design. I used a black background because it adds more contrast to
                        the text and most people associate black backgrounds with computer consoles
                        or terminals. I also wanted the website to feel sleek and modern, just like the
                        iOS and Android operating systems which is why I incorporated large icons
                        and a CSS flip for interaction...

                        This music library was my first website made using a database and it actually uses a text file to save data.
                        You can filter your music by mood with tags to find a perfect song for any time of day. You can also search by Title, Artist, Album,
                        Year, Rating or a combination. Simply change a search parameter to get a list of matching tracks...

                <h2>CS 2300: Intermediate Design and Programming for the Web</h2>
                <p>
                    Web programming requires the cooperation of two machines: the one in
                    front of the viewer (client) and the one delivering the content (server).
                    INFO 1300 concentrates almost exclusively on the client side. The main
                    emphasis in INFO 2300 is learning about server side processing. Students
                    begin with a short overview of the PHP server-side scripting language,
                    then look at interactions with databases, learning about querying via
                    the database language SQL. Through a succession of projects, students
                    learn how to apply this understanding to the creation of an interactive,
                    data-driven site via PHP and the MYSQL database. Also considered are
                    technologies such as Javascript and Ajax and techniques to enhance security
                    and privacy. Design and usability issues are emphasized. A major component
                    of the course is the creation of a substantial web site.
                </p>

                <h2>CS 3410: Systems Programming</h2>
                <p>
                    Introduction to computer organization, systems programming and the
                    hardware/ software interface. Topics include instruction sets, computer
                    arithmetic, datapath design, data formats, addressing modes, memory
                    hierarchies including caches and virtual memory, I/O devices, bus-based
                    I/O systems, and multicore architectures. Students learn assembly
                    language programming and design a pipelined RISC processor.
                </p>

                <h2>CS 4670: Intro to Computer Vision</h2>
                <p>
                    An in-depth introduction to computer vision. The goal of computer vision
                    is to compute properties of our worldâ€”the 3D shape of an environment,
                    the motion of objects, the names of people or thingsâ€”through analysis
                    of digital images or videos. The course covers a range of topics, including
                    3D reconstruction, image segmentation, object recognition, and vision
                    algorithms for the Internet, as well as key algorithmic and optimization
                    techniques, such as graph cuts and non-linear least squares. This course
                    emphasizes hands-on experience with computer vision, with several large
                    programming projects.
                </p>

                <h2>CS 4752: Robotic Manipulation</h2>
                <p>
                    Robotic manipulation is the ability for a robot to interact physically and
                    deliberately in the world. Although long used in factories, robot manipulators
                    will soon appear in home environments as well, helping us with daily tasks.
                    This course covers the theory and concepts involved in programming a robot
                    manipulator, including rigid body mechanics, kinematics, dynamics, path
                    and trajectory planning, control, and stability.  At the end of this course,
                    the student is able to program a real manipulator arm to perform autonomous
                    tasks.
                </p>

                <h2>CS 1300: Intro Design &amp; Prog for Web</h2>
                <p>
                    The World Wide Web is both a technology and a pervasive and powerful resource
                    in our society and culture. To build functional and effective web sites,
                    students need technical and design skills as well as analytical skills for
                    understanding who is using the web, in what ways they are using it, and for
                    what purposes. In this course, students develop skills in all three of these
                    areas through the use of technologies such as XHTML, Cascading Stylesheets,
                    and PHP. Students study how web sites are deployed and used, usability issues
                    on the web, user-centered design, and methods for visual layout and information
                    architecture. Through the web, this course provides an introduction to the
                    interdisciplinary field of information science.
                </p>

                    predicate calculus; combinatorics and discrete mathematics; some basic
                    elements of basic probability theory; basic number theory; sets, functions,
                    and relations; graphs; and finite-state machines. These topics are discussed
                    in the context of applications to many areas of computer science, such as the
                    RSA cryptosystem and web searching.
                </p>

                <h2>MATH 2940: Linear Algebra for Engineers</h2>
                <p>
                    Linear algebra and its applications. Topics include matrices, determinants,
