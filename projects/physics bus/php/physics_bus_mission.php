                <p class= "missiontxt">
                    Here at the Ithaca Physics Bus we are trying to get people of all ages more interested in physics while keeping the activities fun.
                    We explore properties of physics through enjoyable hands on activities that act as a complement to traditional academic physics.  The demonstrations
                    that we do are designed to educate as well as entertain; however, we keep the competitive nature of phsyics confined to a classroom rather than our bus.

                <h2>Mission Two: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</h2>
                <p class="missiontxt">
                    The physics demos that are set up on the bus are all made from reused or recycled materials in order to emphasize environmental
                    conservation.  We want to stress that everything the eye can see is useable for some sort of activity even a sewing machine found
                    on the side of the road can be of use in a demo aboard the physics bus.  This mentality brings out the artistic nature of our physics bus;
                    physics isnt just a science, it is an art form.  to be able to create these exhibits from reused materials requires a keen eye for the arts as well
                    as sciences.
