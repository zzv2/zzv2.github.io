                    Ithaca Physics Bus is a division of Physics Factory, a physics learning center first started 10 years ago in Tuscon, Arizona. Since moving across the country Erik Herman, co-founder of Physics Factory, has taken on a new edition: The Bus, which is now maintained purely through the work of volunteers.<br><br>

                    The bus first came to be a few years ago when a Cornell engineering student traded his Subaru for an old broken down bus to use as a party bus. After graduation, he donated the bus to our organization, and with a little love and a lot of paint the Ithaca Physics Bus was born!<br><br>

                    The Ithaca Physics Bus is about doing science for fun. We'll probably learn something while we're at it, so that's great too.
                    As larger organizations take many things into consideration the Physics Bus can remain simple by design--keeping it real for what's right here, right now.
