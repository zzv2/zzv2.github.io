                    <p> Throughout his life, Erik has had a great passion for physics, but he always felt that high school and college-level physic curriculums were too competetive, designed to push people out based on grades rather than actually inspiring a love of science. So, Erik pursued a major in Philosophy, making a name for himself as "The Physics Dude" by building scientific exhibits with his own materials on his own time. Later on he received his post-baccalauerate physics certification and became a high school physics teacher before taking on The Physics Factory, a place for kids who, like Erik, love science but can't quite get enough experience from a classroom alone. After moving to Ithaca, Erik carried this dream across the country and gave life to the next installation: The Physics Bus.</p>

                    <p>
                        Claire is an artist turned scientist who came to Cornell for Visual Studies and got turned on to electronics and hacking (the good kind) while producing interactive installation art. In 2005 she co-founded a nonprofit learning center before spending two years as a K-12 Museum Educator at the Johnson Art Museum. She has taught hands-on science-based afterschool programs and summer programs at GIAC, the Ovid Library, and TCPL.
                        In 2012 Claire co-founded Ithaca Generator Makerspace, where she served as Education Director and had tons of fun dissecting eyeballs with kids, making everything from paper circuits to squishy robbots, and inventing new uses for microcontrollers. Claire is now working towards a teaching degree in Biology.
                        When she's not studying science, Claire can be found spending time reading books with her two kids, electric bike riding, welding, making things explode, and building exhibits for the Physics Bus!

                    <p> 
                        Chris Bell is a 1st grade teacher at Fall Creek Elementary in Ithaca, NY. He got his B.S. in Sociology at Ithaca College and his teaching degree from SUNY Cortland. He spent his first 5 years teaching 1st grade in Sacramento, CA.  He then returned to Ithaca and has continued in 1st grade for the last 11 years.

                        In addition to his time in the classroom, Chris has worked with kids in a variety of after school roles: running science enrichment classes, co-facilitating Waste to Widgets on the weekends, organizing the Fall Creek Talent Shows, and developing the Fall Creek School of Rock.  He is currently on the steering committee of the Ithaca Physics Bus. 

                        Most important to Chris are his wife and two kids.

                <h2 class= "bios"> Eva Luna, Volunteer </h2>
                <div class="bio_img">
                    <img src= "../images/eva.png" alt= "Claire reading with her kids!">
                    <p> Eva was drawn to science from early on and followed the path of science and engineering all the way to college and graduate school. However, she also felt that her education was lacking creativity and curiosity in the pursuit of science. Now, as an outreach specialist, she provides kids and teachers with the tools to have fun with science as part of their education, and she absolutely loves it!  

                        She is inspired by passionate people and passionate grassroots projects, leading her to the Ithaca Physics Bus. She enjoys helping with anything the Bus needs in terms of logistics and administrative support and hopes to finally get her hands into exhibition making soon. 

                        Eva enjoys reusing old scrap material, finding freebies on Craigslist that she can repurpose, talking anything Dominican (where she was born and raised), dancing swing, latin music, and laughing about pretty much anything.
